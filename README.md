# RSS-Reader

## Description
RSS-Reader is a Java-based application that fetches and displays RSS feeds from various websites, providing users with a simple interface to read and manage their favorite feeds.

## How It Works
### 1. User Input
The user starts the application and provides the URL of the RSS feed they want to fetch. This input is handled via a command-line interface.

### 2. Fetching Data
The application uses the `java.net` package to send an HTTP GET request to the provided RSS feed URL. This is done using classes such as `URL` and `HttpURLConnection`.

### 3. Parsing XML
The fetched data, which is in XML format, is parsed using Java's built-in XML parsing libraries such as `javax.xml.parsers` and `org.w3c.dom`. The application processes the XML to extract the following elements:
- **Title**: The title of the RSS feed or individual articles.
- **Link**: The URL to the full article or feed item.
- **Description**: A brief summary of the article.
- **Publication Date**: The date when the article was published.

### 4. Displaying Feeds
Once the XML data is parsed, the extracted information is formatted and displayed to the user. The console-based interface lists the titles of the feed items, and the user can select an item to view more details.

### 5. Error Handling
The application includes error handling mechanisms to manage:
- **Invalid URLs**: Checking if the provided URL is well-formed and reachable.
- **Network Errors**: Handling issues such as timeouts or connection failures.
- **Malformed XML**: Ensuring the XML fetched from the URL is correctly formatted and can be parsed.

### 6. Caching and Updates (Optional)
For performance improvements, the application could implement caching of previously fetched feeds and check for updates at regular intervals. This feature can be added to reduce the load time and data usage.

## Features
- Fetch and display RSS feeds from multiple sources.
- Display titles, descriptions, and publication dates of feed items.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface for managing feeds.
